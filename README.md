## How to use

1. Download the files. Unzip them into their own folder.
2. Install deno. If you do not have it, use this link to help you:  [Installation | Deno Docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
3. After that, go to the folder it's in (in command prompt).
4. Run `deno run -A main.ts`.
5. Now you can code in Devo!
